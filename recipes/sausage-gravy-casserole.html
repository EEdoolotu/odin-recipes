            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring with a spatula and breaking sausage apart as it cooks, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in onion powder, garlic powder, bouillon granules, and black pepper until well combined and sausage fully cooked, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Stir in flour until mixture coated, then stir in milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer; stir until thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Taste; adjust seasonings. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter; set aside.</li>
                <li>Cut each biscuit into four pieces. Arrange ½ biscuits in bottom of the prepared baking dish; cover with sausage-gravy mixture. Top with remaining ½ biscuits.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are fully cooked and golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Set aside before serving for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
